# Arduino-code-to-turn-stepper-motor-mks-dlc32-74hc595-onboard

The Makerbase MKS DLC32 v2.1 uses an onboard 74HC595 high-speed CMOS 8-bit shift register with output latches (3-state).

This example demonstrates the pins used to control all three stepper motors.  A sample code snippet is provided to control the X-axis stepper motor.

During my research, I encountered inconsistencies in how the pins are named and referenced in various sources.  This code aims to clarify these discrepancies.
